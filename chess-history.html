				<h1>History of Chess</h1>
				<p>
					The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1,500 years to its
					earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its
					prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to
					Persia, where it was modified in terms of shapes and rules and
					developed into Shatranj. Following the Arab invasion and conquest
					of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and
					subsequently spread to Europe via Spain (Al Andalus) and Italy
					(Emirate of Sicily). The game evolved roughly into its current
					form by about 1500 CE. "Romantic chess" was the predominant
					playing style from the late 18th century to the 1880s.[1] Chess
					games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather
					than long-term strategic planning.[1] The Romantic era of play
					was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism
					eras.[1] In the second half of the 19th century, modern chess
					tournament play began, and the first official World Chess
					Championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw great leaps
					forward in chess theory and the establishment of the World Chess
					Federation. In 1997, an IBM supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov,
					the then world chess champion, in the famous Deep Blue versus
					Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game into an era of computer
					domination. Since then, computer analysis – which originated in
					the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the market –
					has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and
					has become an important part of preparation in professional human
					chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the use of
					computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human player
					accessible to the public. Online chess, which first appeared in
					the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.

				<h2>Basic Moves</h2>
				<p>
					Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece
					moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's
					piece.[8] Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces
					cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken)
					when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The
					captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.[a]
					The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).
					The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or
					diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is
					allowed only once per player, per game (see below). A rook moves
					any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also
					is moved when castling. A bishop moves any number of vacant
					squares diagonally. (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark
					squares, not both.) The queen moves any number of vacant squares
					horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A knight moves to one of
					the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.
					(This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then
					one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two
					squares vertically—i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight is not
					blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location. Pawns have
					the most complex rules of movement: A pawn moves straight forward
					one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a
					pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward,
					provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards. A
					pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it
					moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two
					squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those
					squares when vacant except when capturing en passant. The pawn is
					also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.
