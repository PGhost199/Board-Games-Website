				<h1>Board Games History</h1>
				<p>
					The history of board games spans thousands of years and reflects
					the cultural, social, and technological developments of
					civilizations throughout time. While it's difficult to pinpoint
					the exact origins of board games, archaeological evidence
					suggests that they have been played since ancient times.One of
					the oldest known board games is Senet, which dates back to
					ancient Egypt around 3500 BCE. Senet was a game of strategy and
					luck played on a board with 30 squares arranged in three rows of
					ten. It had religious significance and was often included in
					burial goods, indicating its importance in Egyptian culture.Board
					games also flourished in ancient Mesopotamia, where the Royal
					Game of Ur, dating back to around 2600 BCE, was unearthed. This
					game involved a race between two players to move their pieces
					across a board of rectangular spaces.In ancient China, the game
					of Go emerged around 2000 BCE. Go is a strategic board game
					played on a grid with black and white stones, with the objective
					of controlling territory on the board.Chess, one of the most
					famous and enduring board games, originated in India around the
					6th century CE before spreading to Persia and eventually Europe.
					Chess is a game of strategy and tactics played on an 8x8 grid
					board, where players maneuver pieces to checkmate the opponent's
					king.

						<p>[Music]</p>
						<p>and across the board we're very proud of</p>
						<p>our libraries that teachers almost 1200</p>
						<p>thailand's at this point a lot of our</p>
						<p>first-time customers come to us and say</p>
						<p>wow I had no idea that there were that</p>
						<p>many games out there well even though</p>
						<p>we're very proud of our collection was</p>
						<p>game geeks.com which is a very popular</p>
						<p>board game collectors website has run</p>
						<p>70,000 titles in its database at this</p>
						<p>point so I thought let's take some time</p>
						<p>today and talk about some of the games</p>
						<p>that you can find here in our library</p>
						<p>now we of course have the classics like</p>
						<p>chess and Chinese checkers that have</p>
						<p>been around for hundreds of years and</p>
						<p>obviously are good enough to withstand</p>
						<p>the test of time I myself grew up in</p>
						<p>Germany in the late 70s and of course I</p>
						<p>knew games like monopoly even then it</p>
						<p>was a relatively old game Monopoly in</p>
						<p>fact was created in 1903 so at this</p>
						<p>point it is more than a hundred years</p>
						<p>old and of course we had games like flu</p>
						<p>or risk North American games that again</p>
						<p>were very popular in Europe as well but</p>
						<p>people thought why do we limit our</p>
						<p>experience to games that are that old</p>
						<p>now a lot of us probably also have</p>
						<p>relatively bad memories about playing</p>
						<p>games like monopoly or risk because</p>
						<p>those games are based on elimination</p>
						<p>meaning that if you get kicked out you</p>
						<p>can sit on the culture mode for two or</p>
						<p>three hours while your friends finish</p>
						<p>the game by themselves not the greatest</p>
						<p>experience so a lot of designers in</p>
						<p>Germany or other Central European</p>
						<p>countries decided to create new games</p>
						<p>which are now called euro games games</p>
						<p>like labyrinths came on the market or</p>
						<p>games like Scotland Yard which by the</p>
						<p>way for those of you that care is the</p>
						<p>first published cooperative game now so</p>
						<p>many games were created in those years</p>
						<p>the Germans decided to hand out an award</p>
						<p>called spiel des jahres</p>
						<p>technically translated game of the year</p>
						<p>the biggest success in recent history is</p>
						<p>in 1995 when a game called the Settlers</p>
						<p>of Catan hit the market now called</p>
						<p>katana</p>
						<p>Settlers of Catan is the perfect example</p>
						<p>of a hero game everybody is involved in</p>
						<p>the game when somebody rules to die</p>
						<p>whatever the die roll is has an impact</p>
						<p>of everyone's game you might get some</p>
						<p>resources or you might lose some things</p>
						<p>plus after that you get to trade with</p>
						<p>each other for these resources in other</p>
						<p>words every player is part of the gaming</p>
						<p>process until the game comes to an end</p>
						<p>if somebody wins ten points now not</p>
						<p>every game has to be about strategy or</p>
						<p>point collecting or road building now</p>
						<p>the latest winner of this really chalice</p>
						<p>of 2016 in the game called code names</p>
						<p>code names is technically a party game</p>
						<p>in other words you can play with four</p>
						<p>people and more but it incorporates a</p>
						<p>bit of a strategy in a bit of a very</p>
						<p>interesting puzzle mechanic so doesn't</p>
						<p>matter if you like the traditional games</p>
						<p>or the vintage games the classics or any</p>
						<p>of the brand-new ones we would love to</p>
						<p>show you some titles that we have here</p>
						<p>across the board so come on down and</p>
						<p>check out all the fun that we have in</p>
						<p>store for you</p>
