					<h3>Introduction to chess:</h3>
					<p>
						Chess is a classic board game played by two players on an 8x8
						grid board. Each player starts with 16 pieces: a king, a
						queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
						The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the
						king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape. Chess
						requires strategic thinking, foresight, and tactical prowess
						as players maneuver their pieces to control the board and
						outwit their opponent. It's a timeless game of skill and
						strategy that has been enjoyed for centuries across cultures
						worldwide.

					<h3>Simple checker moves:</h3>
					<p>
						Checkers, also known as Draughts in some countries, is a
						classic board game played on an 8x8 grid board. Each player
						starts with 12 pieces, typically represented by discs of
						contrasting colors, usually black and white. The objective is
						to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them from
						making any legal moves. Pieces can move diagonally forward,
						capturing opponent's pieces by jumping over them. If a piece
						reaches the opponent's back row, it becomes a "king" and gains
						the ability to move and capture diagonally backwards. Checkers
						is a game of strategy, foresight, and tactical maneuvering,
						offering simple rules but deep gameplay that has entertained
						players of all ages for generations.

					<h3>Things you donâ€™t know about poker:</h3>
					<p>
						Poker is a popular card game that combines elements of skill,
						strategy, and gambling. It is typically played with a standard
						52-card deck, though variations exist. The objective of poker
						varies depending on the variant being played, but generally
						involves players betting on the strength of their hand
						compared to others, with the goal of either having the best
						hand at the showdown or convincing others to fold their
						hands.While the earliest known form of the game was played
						with just 20 cards, today it is usually played with a standard
						deck, although in countries where short packs are common, it
						may be played with 32, 40 or 48 cards.
